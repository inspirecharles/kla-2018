		                                    When you visit a page of LRN Websites that contains a social plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to Facebook servers. Facebook directly transfers the plugin content to your browser, which embeds the latter into the website, enabling Facebook to receive information that you have accessed the respective page of LRN Websites. LRN has no influence on the data gathered by the plugin.

		                                    The embedded plugins provide Facebook with the information that You have accessed the corresponding page of LRN Websites. If you are logged into Facebook, your visit can be assigned to your Facebook account. If you interact with the plugins, for example by clicking “Like”, or entering a comment, the corresponding information is transmitted from your browser directly to Facebook and stored by Facebook. Even if you are not logged into Facebook, there is possibility that the plugins transmit your IP-address to Facebook.

		                                    LRN Websites use the “Twitter Tweet Button” provided by MediaSift Ltd, Building L033, London Road, University of Reading, Reading, RG1 5AQ, United Kingdom. The button can be recognized by its twitter logo (a white "t" on a blue background or a white "little bird", both perhaps connected with the addition of "Tweet").

		                                    <br/><br/>

		                                    With the “Twitter Tweet Button”, Twitter users can share LRN Websites via Twitter. The button also shows the number of tweets for each comment made.

		                                    When you visit a page on LRN Websites that includes such a plugin, your browser connects directly with the servers at MediaSift. The content of the “Twitter Tweet Button” is transferred from MediaSift directly to your browser, which incorporates it into the website. LRN has no influence on the amount of data gathered by MediaSift through this plugin, and provide this information to the best of our knowledge, which is that only the IP address of your connection and the URL of our page are transmitted when the button is acquired, but are not used for purposes other than display of the button.
